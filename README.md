# docker-practice

The Goal for the next practice is to understand and build a basic system with a docker compose strucuture ... the system would be already be build your goals :

- generate the dockerfile to build the container.
- generate the docker-compose.yml to run the system.
- understand the network base and the logic behind the system itself 
- play and break stuff on your local env.
